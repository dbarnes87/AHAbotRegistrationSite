Why You Need This: 
	Home Assistant is what controls your smart devices at home and allows you to send them 	commands with the Slack Bot.

	Once this is complete, you should be able to visit the website 	http://hassio.local:8123 and view the Home Assistant on your local network.

Step 2: Create a "Long-Lived Access Token" within Home Assistant.

How To Do It:
	Inside Home Assistant, click on your User Account in the bottom left corner, then 	scroll to the bottom of that page and click "Create Token". Save that token; you'll need 	it in step 4.

Why You Need This:
	This token is needed to authorize the Home Assistant to accept commands from the Slack 	Bot.

Step 3: Configure Duck DNS, and install it as an add-on on your Home Assistant.

How To Do It:
	Go to DuckDNS.org, sign in (with Google, Github, etc.), and create a DuckDNS domain 	and DuckDNS token. Go to Home Assistant website, and under the Hass.io page, add the 	DuckDNS add-on and configure it with your DuckDNS domain and token.

Why You Need This:
	DuckDNS provides a simple way to refer to a server/router with a name that doesn't 	change, rather than just an IP address which is likely to change often.

Step 4: Register on the AHA_Bot Registration Website.

How To Do It:
	Go to https://ahabot-registration.herokuapp.com/
	Click Sign in with Slack
	Sign in to your Slack workspace and grant access.
	The website will prompt you to enter two fields: URL and Access Token.
		Enter the DuckDNS domain for 'URL' (i.e. yourdomain.duckdns.org).
		Enter the Long-Lived Access Token for 'Access token'.
		Click Submit.
	On the "Your registration was successful!" page, click "Add to Slack".
	On the next page, confirm your identity and select a Slack Channel to submit and 	receive messages from the Bot.
	
Why You Need This:
	This connects the Slack Bot to your Home Assistant.
